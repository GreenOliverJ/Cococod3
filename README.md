Apart from my artistic career, I'm also a team leader. I have managed and opened 3 boutique hotels in Madrid, managing teams from 10 to 30 employees and leaded teams of surf instructors.

I was born in Finland but have been raised in MÃ¡laga. My family on my father's side is English and mother's Finnish. I speak the three languages.
*My five year plan would be: me, able to work in web development, be part of a pasionate project, manage my own team and escape every now and then to surf* :ocean:
